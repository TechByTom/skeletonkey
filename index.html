    <p>For iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch, you can follow <a href="ios.html">these instructions</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    
    <p>When you need to create a password, click the bookmarklet link, enter a long passphrase at the prompt, and click OK.</p>
    
    <p>Paste the displayed password into the page's password field.</p>
    
    <p>As long as you always type in the exact same passphrase on that site, you will get the same generated password and be able to log back in later.</p>

    <p>You can reuse the same passphrase for every site you visit, but please do make sure the phrase is very long and hard to guess. A sentence that is easy to remember and known only to you is best.</p>
    
    <h2>Details</h2>
    
    <p>Skeleton Key uses the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">SHA-256</a> and <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2104.txt">RFC 2104</a> HMAC algorithms to combine the site domain and passphrase.</p>
    
    <p>By default, the generated site password will be 14 characters of base 58 encoded text.  This carries about 82 bits of entropy and complies with the password rules of most sites.</p>
    
    <p>If you need a shorter password or special characters to satisfy restrictive site rules, just make the change to the generated password before you paste it into the password field.  Of course, you can always modify the bookmarklet source code to better suit your needs.</p>
    
    <h2>Building</h2>
    
    <p>The project includes a <code>build.js</code> file which minifies the Javascript source and then URI encodes it.  The script requires <a href="https://github.com/joyent/node">Node</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS">UglifyJS</a>.</p>
    
    <p>You can also use the included Python version of the Skeleton Key logic to test the correctness of the compiled bookmarklet.</p>
